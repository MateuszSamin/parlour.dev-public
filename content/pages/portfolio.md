    tagline: The blockchain social media
    description: >
      We've been commissioned to create a social media application integrated
      with blockchain. We had to design the app from scratch, which gave us full
      freedom of choosing the tech stack. Because Kolor is a dapp, we had to
      ensure a certain level of decentralization (for example, no popular
      solutions such as AWS and Google Firebase). This was a whole new
      challenge, given that decentralized technologies integrated with
      blockchain are at a very early stage of development. Because of that, we
      had to resort to creating our own, innovative methods.


      We overcame every obstacle concerning integrating such novel ideas into
      the project, which resulted in the creation of a [landing
      page](https://kolor.social), a [dapp](https://app.kolor.social) and a
      back-end which handles the app.
    built: >
      Front-end was written in ReactJS, smart contracts were written in  
      Solidity. Back-end was written in Golang, with further integration 
      provided by a decentralized file hosting - Storj.

      ReactJS, useDapp, ethers.js, TypeScript, CSS, Golang, Infura, Netflify,
      various Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain APIs

    tagline: A mobile app for ordering services
    description: >
      We've been commissioned to design both the product and the app. We&#x20;

      had full freedom of choosing the tech stack. There was only a single&#x20;

      condition, the app was meant to work on both iOS and Android
      devices.&#x20;

      The work began from creating a few mockups of the app, in order to&#x20;

      choose the proper visual identification. We settled on a UI which
      was&#x20;

      based on bright colors, with strong orange accents. That way, the&#x20;

      entirety was consistent with the PukPuk logo. Simultaneously, work began

      &#x20;on implementing the front-end and the back-end.
    built: |
      The project consisted of creating a mobile app, which lets users&#x20;
      offer and use various services. PukPuk was created from scratch by us.

      We chose the tech stack and the app architecture. Front-end was&#x20;
      written in React Native while back-end was created using Golang and AWS.
    stack: >-
      React Native, TypeScript, StyledComponents, CSS, Golang. We also built an
      HTML / CSS landing page for the project.
