  - name: Kolor - blockchain social media dapp
    description: >
      ## Description


      The project consisted of designing and coding a social media platform
      integrated with the blockchain. Integration with the MetaMask wallet lets
      users put their posts on blockchain or mint them as NFTs.


      ## What did we build?


      Front-end was written in ReactJS, smart contracts were written in
      Solidity. Back-end was written in Golang, with further integration
      provided by a decentralized file hosting - Storj.


      ## Tech stack


      ReactJS, useDapp, ethers.js, TypeScript, CSS, Golang, Infura, Netflify,
      various Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain APIs.

      We've been commissioned to create a social media application integrated
      with blockchain. We had to design the app from scratch, which gave us full
      freedom of choosing the tech stack. Because Kolor is a dapp, we had to
      ensure a certain level of decentralization (for example, no popular
      solutions such as AWS and Google Firebase). This was a whole new
      challenge, given that decentralized technologies integrated with
      blockchain are at a very early stage of development. Because of that, we
      had to resort to creating our own, innovative methods.


      We overcame every obstacle concerning integrating such novel ideas into
      the project, which resulted in the creation of a [landing
      page](https://kolor.social), a [dapp](https://app.kolor.social) and a
      back-end which handles the app.

  - name: PukPuk - mobile app for ordering services
    description: >
      ## Description


      The project consisted of creating a mobile app, which lets users offer and
      use various services. PukPuk was created from scratch by us.


      ## What did we build?


      We chose the tech stack and the app architecture. Front-end was written in
      React Native while back-end was created using Golang and AWS.


      ## Tech stack


      React Native, TypeScript, StyledComponents, CSS, Golang. We also built an
      HTML / CSS landing page for the project.

      We've been commissioned to design both the product and the app. We had
      full freedom of choosing the tech stack. There was only a single
      condition, the app was meant to work on both iOS and Android devices. The
      work began from creating a few mockups of the app, in order to choose the
      proper visual identification. We settled on a UI which was based on bright
      colors, with strong orange accents. That way, the entirety was consistent
      with the PukPuk logo. Simultaneously, work began on implementing the
      front-end and the back-end.

  - name: Mindset - online therapy sessions
    description: >
      ## Description


      The project consisted of creating a mobile app, which lets users contact
      therapists while in need of psychological help. We've been commissioned to
      code the app after being given the UI.The app was to be fully responsive
      and maximally secure.


      ## What did we build?


      Front-end was written in React Native with the back-end being handled by
      Firebase.


      ## Tech stack


      React Native, Firebase, various security measures.

      During the pandemic, the need for online medical help arose. Thus, we have
      been approached by a Polish startup - Mindset.Due to the nature of the
      service (online therapy sessions and chats) we had to ensure absolute
      security and privacy. We used both open-source solutionsand our own,
      non-public tools. This way, we created a safe environment for clients. We
      then smoothly went through approval in the Apple App Store.
