  - name: Kolor
    tagline: The blockchain social media
    description: >
      We've been commissioned to create a social media application integrated
      with blockchain. We had to design the app from scratch, which gave us full
      freedom of choosing the tech stack. Because Kolor is a dapp, we had to
      ensure a certain level of decentralization (for example, no popular
      solutions such as AWS and Google Firebase). This was a whole new
      challenge, given that decentralized technologies integrated with
      blockchain are at a very early stage of development. Because of that, we
      had to resort to creating our own, innovative methods.


      We overcame every obstacle concerning integrating such novel ideas into
      the project, which resulted in the creation of a [landing
      page](https://kolor.social), a [dapp](https://app.kolor.social) and a
      back-end which handles the app.
    built: >
      Front-end was written in ReactJS, smart contracts were written in  
      Solidity. Back-end was written in Golang, with further integration 
      provided by a decentralized file hosting - Storj.
    stack: >-
      ReactJS, useDapp, ethers.js, TypeScript, CSS, Golang, Infura, Netflify,
      various Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain APIs
