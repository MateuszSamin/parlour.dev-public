  - name: Kolor
    tagline: The blockchain social media
    description: >
      We've been commissioned to create a social media application integrated
      with blockchain. We had to design the app from scratch, which gave us full
      freedom of choosing the tech stack. Because Kolor is a dapp, we had to
      ensure a certain level of decentralization (for example, no popular
      solutions such as AWS and Google Firebase). This was a whole new
      challenge, given that decentralized technologies integrated with
      blockchain are at a very early stage of development. Because of that, we
      had to resort to creating our own, innovative methods.


      We overcame every obstacle concerning integrating such novel ideas into
      the project, which resulted in the creation of a [landing
      page](https://kolor.social), a [dapp](https://app.kolor.social) and a
      back-end which handles the app.

      Kolor was a project that was in a very early stage when we started working
      on it, so we had complete freedom over choosing the technology solutions.
      What we delivered was a fullstack Web3 application that consisted of
      various elements. The project started with designing the UI and UX of the
      app. We wanted to have a simple Twitter-like design with the extraordinary
      Web3 feel. We wanted the user to feel like they're travelling through
      outer space while scrolling thorugh Kolor. Therefore, we used the dark and
      mystical color palette. Completed with on-hover animations, we delivered a
      great user experience. Then we moved on to front-end programming. Using
      ReactJS, CSS, useDapp, ethers.js and various other libraries, we delivered
      a UI that looked exactly like the design and was fully responsive. Then we
      moved on to programming the smart contracts. These were written in
      Solidity using Hardhat enviroment and thoroughly tested using AI-enhanced
      fuzzing. To make the UX smoother and less costly, we moved some of the
      business logic and operations off-chain. The back-end was written in
      Golang, with the goal to be robust and lightning-fast.


      Smart contracts for this project were quite complex, as Kolor is an
      innovative project and in some cases we had to invent solutions to
      never-seen-before problems. We managed to do that and ship the application
      just as intended, meeting all of our  deadlines. The entire development
      process took us about 3 months.


      We finished off the project by creating a great looking landing page with
      ReactJS and TailwindCSS,  so the user can get to know Kolor before jumping
      in.
    stack: >-
      ReactJS for the front-end logic and components, CSS for styling and making
      it look great, useDapp and ethers.js for seamless integration with
      blockchain, TypeScript to keep the project scalable and avoid tech debt,
      Golang for creating a robust off-chain back-end, Infura for connecting to
      the blockchain network using their node, Netlify for building and
      deploying the app, GitHub for version tracking and collaboration and
      various less relevant Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain APIs. The smart
      contracts were written in Solidity with the use of Hardhard development
      enviroment.

  - name: PukPuk
    tagline: A mobile app for ordering services
    description: >
      We've been commissioned to design both the product and the app. We&#x20;

      had full freedom of choosing the tech stack. There was only a single&#x20;

      condition, the app was meant to work on both iOS and Android
      devices.&#x20;

      The work began from creating a few mockups of the app, in order to&#x20;

      choose the proper visual identification. We settled on a UI which
      was&#x20;

      based on bright colors, with strong orange accents. That way, the&#x20;

      entirety was consistent with the PukPuk logo. Simultaneously, work began

      &#x20;on implementing the front-end and the back-end.
    built: >
      The project consisted of creating a mobile app, which lets users&#x20;

      offer and use various services. We were able to create the project from
      scratch, using scalable tech and making it robust.


      PukPuk started with creating the design for the app. We wanted to deliver
      a friendly, yet simple design and would be intuitive and easy to navigate.
      We went for warm colors that would make the app look welcoming to use.


      Then we went on to build the front-end of the app using React Native. The
      biggest challange here was implementing a map with user-created pins into
      the application, but we managed to swiftly overcome it. We added user
      account with email and password, as well as integration with Facebook and
      Google sign-ins.


      We chose to create the back-end using Golang and AWS, for the easy
      scalability and low starting cost, as PukPuk was a startup in an early
      stage where cutting costs was very important.


      We also created a landing page for the project using simple HTML and CSS
      to introduce new users to the app and encourage them to try it out!
    stack: >-
      React Native for the front-end markup and logic, TypeScript and
      StyledComponents for scalability, CSS for styling, Golang for the
      back-end. We also built a responsive HTML / CSS landing page for the
      project.
