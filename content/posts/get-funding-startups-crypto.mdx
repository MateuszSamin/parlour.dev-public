# Traditional ways of startup funding

If you're looking to start a company, there are a few tried and true methods of obtaining funding. One is to go the VC route: find some wealthy investors who are willing to risk their money on your business venture. This can be a great option, but it's not always easy to find the right investors, and even if you do, they may not be interested in investing in your particular startup.

Another option is to bootstrap your company: self-fund it with your own savings or by taking out loans. This can be a great way to retain control of your company, but it can also be very risky. If your startup doesn't succeed, you'll be left with a lot of debt to pay off.

A third option is to look into crowdfunding. This can be a great way to raise money from a large group of people, but it can also be tough to reach your fundraising goal, and you may not end up with as much money as you'd hoped for.

And then there's crypto. In recent years, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency have created new opportunities for startups to raise funds.

# Why use crypto for startup funding?

Cryptocurrency has emerged as a popular way to finance startups in recent years. There are a few reasons why crypto is attractive for startup funding. First, crypto is a new and exciting asset class that can help startups stand out from the crowd. Second, crypto is a global asset class, so it can attract investors from all over the world. Third, crypto is a relatively young asset class, so there are still plenty of opportunities for early-stage startups to get in on the ground floor. Finally, crypto is a volatile asset class, so it can provide startups with the potential for high returns.

# Create an NFT collection to fund your startup

If you're looking for funding for your startup, one option is to create an NFT collection. This can be a great way to raise money, as you usually sell your NFTs for cryptocurrency. This can be a great option if you have a creative or innovative idea for an NFT collection. There are a few things to keep in mind when creating an NFT collection to fund your startup. First, you'll need to create a compelling story or offer something unique that will attract buyers. Always think about the utility you can offer to your buyers. Secondly, you'll need to price your NFTs appropriately. If you price them too high, you may not sell any; if you price them too low, you won't make enough money to fund your startup. Finally, you'll need to promote your NFT collection and get it in front of potential buyers. You can do this by listing it on popular NFT marketplaces or by using social media and other online channels. With some planning and effort, raising money through an NFT collection is a viable option for many startups.

# How much funding can I get from an NFT collection?

If you're a startup looking for funding, you may be wondering if you can get funding from an NFT collection. The answer is yes! Depending on the size and quality of your collection, you could potentially raise a lot of money to help fund your startup. So, if you're looking for alternative ways to raise funds, consider NFTs!

Some startups raised as much as $10 000 000 by creating an NFT collection for its early believers. It’s all down to what value you can provide and how well you can market the NFT.

# The advantage of launching an NFT collection - get a cut of every sale!

An important benefit that is tightly associated with NFT is the resale. As an NFT creator you will get a cut of every following resale of your token. It means that you’ll be able to get constant cashflow from it even years after launching the collection. It is important to keep the community alive and engaged.That can provide a nice stream of revenue. Also, it's a great way to get your company's name and products out there.

# How to launch a great NFT collection?

NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets that can be bought, sold, or traded. They're often used to represent items in video games or digital art collections, but they can really be anything. And because each NFT is unique, they can be quite valuable.

So how do you go about launching an NFT collection? First, you'll need to create your digital assets. This can be anything from artwork to videos to 3D models. Once you have your assets ready, you'll need to list them on an NFT marketplace. There are a number of these platforms out there, so do some research to find one that's right for you.

Once your assets are listed, people will be able to buy them using cryptocurrency. This is a great way to raise funds for your startup, as you'll be able to keep all of the money raised.

# How to make sure my NFT collection sells out?

To sell out your NFT collection you need to be able to provide actual value to the potential buyers. The most obvious way to do that is by making sure you have a great product. If you want to sell out, it’s not enough to just have the best product ever. You need people to know about it and want it.

The best way to do that is by creating hype around it. If people are excited about your product, they will be eager to buy it—and even more so if there is a limited supply available!

Creating hype around your NFT collection takes time and effort, but it’s worth it if you want your collection to sell out fast!

If you have created an NFT that represents something that people would like to own — whether it is a limited edition artwork or a limited edition BHP stock certificate — then it's possible that you can sell out your NFT collection. However, if you're just selling digital assets with no real physical representation, then it's unlikely that anyone will want to purchase them.

# What steps do I need to take to make sure my NFT collection sells out?

If you want to sell out your NFT collection, you need to take a few steps.

First, give your audience the reason to buy your NFTs, make it something more than just a pretty image. Promote your NFTs on social media and via influencers. Create a great website that explains your vision with the NFTs and allow users to mint the tokens there.

Next, create an exclusive club for your NFT holders where they can trade their tokens with others and get special benefits from you. You can also offer discounts or other perks like early access to new products or exclusive items only available if you own certain NFTs in your collection.

Finally, keep adding more and more content so people keep coming back for more.

# Create a crypto token to fund my startup

Creating a crypto token to fund your startup is a great way to get the funding you need. There are a few ways to do this, but the most popular method is to launch an initial coin offering (ICO).

An ICO is when you create a new crypto token and sell it to investors in exchange for funding. This is a great way to raise money for your startup because it allows you to tap into the huge pool of crypto investors. Plus, it gives you a chance to sell your tokens at a higher price later down the road.

There are a few things to keep in mind when launching an ICO, though. First, you need to make sure your token is unique and has a good use case. Second, you need to create a strong marketing campaign to attract investors. And last, you need to make sure you comply with all the legal requirements in your jurisdiction.

# How much funding can I get from creating a cryptocurrency?

If you've read this far, then you probably already know that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are volatile assets. But what if you could create your own coin? You might be able to raise money for your startup by creating a cryptocurrency. This is a way to raise money in an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), which is similar to an Initial Public Offering (IPO), but instead of companies going public, we’re talking about the first time a cryptocurrency gets sold.

Here's how much you can expect to get from an ICO:

The average amount that startups have raised through ICOs is $25 million.

Most startups are able to sell 10% of their tokens at their ICO, but some have sold more than 50%.

# Why do most crypto tokens fail?

Most of cryptocurrencies fail, because they don't have anything more to them than just being a cryptocurrency. Attach more value to your token, promote it and you can be sure to get the funding you need.

Here are some examples of why most of crypto tokens fail:

## Creating a new blockchain

The blockchain technology is not yet widely understood by the public, so many companies try to create their own blockchain. This is a big mistake, as it takes time and money before your project can even start working. A better solution would be to use existing blockchains and create a utility token for your project, which is much easier and faster.

## No utility and no real value

The most common reason why most cryptocurrencies fail is because they don't have a product or service that they can offer to the users. This is one of the basic rules when creating an altcoin: if there's no need for your coin or token, it will never be successful. You must have a clear vision of what you want to achieve with your new currency and how it will affect people's lives. Most crypto tokens are just an idea without any real-world application. That's why investors do not invest in them - they require proof of concept and actual usage before investing millions into something that might not work out in the end.

## Not enough effort put into marketing

If people don't know about your new cryptocurrency, then how are they going to buy it? It's very important for every crypto project to put in place an effective marketing strategy from day one and make sure that their target audience understands what the token is all about and how it can benefit them. If your currency doesn't have enough marketing budget behind it, then it might not reach its full potential as far as adoption goes.

## No sales tactic

You’re not alone if you have a virtual currency and no one wants to buy it. You might have spent months developing a strong brand and launching a new token, but if you don’t know how to sell it, chances are no one will ever use it.

# How to make sure my cryptocurrency sells out during ICO?

To make sure your cryptocurrency sells out during ICO, you need to do the following:

Make sure to put enough effort into marketing and attach value additional value to your token. If you don’t have a marketing strategy, I suggest getting in touch with companies that do token marketing. These companies have worked with many ICOs in the past and have a good understanding of how to market an ICO properly.

If you can’t afford marketing, then start by creating a community on Discord or other social media platforms so people know about your project before it launches.

The marketing is the most important part of your ICO. Make sure to put enough effort into it and attach value additional value to your token.

If you want to be successful in your ICO, you need to create an attractive story around your project. You are not just selling an idea with no real-life application or product – you are selling a dream!

It’s not just about creating a website or white paper and then launching your ICO. If you want to get noticed by investors, you need to create hype around your project before launching it.

The key is building trust with investors before they even see anything about the product that you’re trying to sell them on. One way is by offering free tokens for early supporters or by giving away free access to beta versions of the software or product that you are developing.

You should also create an extensive whitepaper that explains the idea of your project and how it will work. You can use services like Whitepaper Online or Whitepaper Maker for this purpose.

The whitepaper should include information about the team behind the project as well as its advisors.
