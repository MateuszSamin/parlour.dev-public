I love how transparent they were about how they work. From day one,
I could look into each step of the development process and contact
them at any time if needed. They are a team of very insightful people.

Parlour not only developed our product but also helped us understand different approaches to launching an NFT app. They know everything about crypto, both the technicalities and the culture surrounding it. I am looking forward to working with them again!

Working with Parlour Development has not only been a great business but a great pleasure. This young, open-minded team delivered my project on time and guided me through each step of the process. 

The best thing about working with Parlor was how well the communication went. They always answer phones and mail. I loved how their feedback and consulting made my project even better. I am definitely looking forward to working with them again in future.
